Solar System Simulation (sss) is a python simulation of small objects traversing through the solar system.  

Initial Capability
- Gravitional effects on small objects from the sun and 8 planets plus Pluto
- Planet positions (and Pluto) are estimated from (reference paper here)

Future Capability
- Planet natural satellites
- Varying time steps based upon acceleration magnitude
- Asteroid belt modelling
- Man-made spacecraft guidance and control
- Man-made spacecraft propulsion modelling
